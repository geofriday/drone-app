In an ideal world, we have the ability to plan a proper flight collection mission and capture imagery in a systematic way including proper over lap and consistent heights.  In many cases, however, that simply is not happening and users of that kind of imagery are left in need of a simple solution for relaizing the benfits of GIS style processing without ALL of the fuss.

This project seeks to make an ap that takes user uploaded images and 1) maps the spatial extent of the job and builds backgound map, 2) maps each indvidual image to its correct orientation on the ground, and 3) merge the images into a format amendible to GIS processing (i.e. multi-band imagery) into products like NDVI or relfectivity.
